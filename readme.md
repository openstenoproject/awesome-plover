### Collections

## Plugins

### Commands

Plugins that control your system or Plover itself.

- [VLC Commands](https://github.com/benoit-pierre/plover_vlc_commands) - Play, pause, seek, and adjust the rate of VLC media player with steno strokes. Paired with your favorite text editor, it makes an excellent transcription tool. It even has support for outputting the current timestamp.
