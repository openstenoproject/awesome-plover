Dictionaries and python dictionaries to make the Plover experience better.

### Collections

- [Di's Steno Dictionaries](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries) - A wonderfully organized list of dictionaries from the maker of Typey Type with everything from removing misstrokes from Plover Theory, to advice on computer use, alternative locales, and programming.

### Programming

- [Emily's Symbols](https://github.com/EPLHREU/emily-symbols) - A genius python dictionary that allows you to write symbols with full control over spacing on both sides of the symbol, capitalization, and count.

## Plugins

### Commands

Plugins that control your system or Plover itself.

- [Dict Commands](https://github.com/KoiOates/plover_dict_commands) - Enable, disable, and reorder dictionaries with steno strokes.

### Dictionary Formats

Plugins that add new dictionary types.

- [Python Dictionary (.py)](https://pypi.org/project/plover-python-dictionary/) - Dictionaries that are small python scripts -- the possibilities are limitless! A few extremely useful Python dictionaries make this plugin a must-have.

### Text Macros

Plugins that affect text output and translation.

- [Repeat last translation](https://github.com/nsmarkop/plover_last_translation) - Repeat the last translation (word, shortcut, emoji, etc.) with a single stroke.
