## Dictionaries

### Collections

- [Di's Steno Dictionaries](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries) - A wonderfully organized list of dictionaries from the maker of Typey Type with everything from removing misstrokes from Plover Theory, to advice on computer use, alternative locales, and programming.

### Phrasing

- [Jade-GG's Phrasing](https://github.com/Jade-GG/plover_phrasing) - A python dictionary phrasing system that lets you write entire phrases such as "we don't really want to" in one stroke.

### Programming

- [Emily's Modifiers](https://github.com/EPLHREU/emily-modifiers) - A python dictionary to allow you to make any keyboard shortcut (with any number of modifiers) in one stroke.
- [Emily's Symbols](https://github.com/EPLHREU/emily-symbols) - A python dictionary that allows you to write symbols with full control over spacing on both sides of the symbol, capitalization, and count.

## Plugins

### Commands

- [Dict Commands](https://github.com/KoiOates/plover_dict_commands) - Enable, disable, and reorder dictionaries with steno strokes.
- [Open URL](https://github.com/nsmarkop/plover_open_url) - Open a website or file with a steno stroke, which can make Googling a spelling while transcribing much easier.
- [System Switcher](https://github.com/nsmarkop/plover_system_switcher) - Switch between different steno systems on the fly, critical for multilingual stenography.
- [VLC Commands](https://github.com/benoit-pierre/plover_vlc_commands) - Play, pause, seek, and adjust the rate of VLC media player with steno strokes. Paired with your favorite text editor, it makes an excellent transcription tool. It even has support for outputting the current timestamp.

### Dictionary Formats

- [Python Dictionary `py`](https://pypi.org/project/plover-python-dictionary/) - Dictionaries that are small python scripts—limitless possibilities! A few extremely useful Python dictionaries make this plugin a must-have.

### Text Macros

- [Fancy Text](https://github.com/psethwick/plover_fancytext) - Switch between typing in all sorts of exotic modes. It's essential if you want to keep up with the kids, supporting everything from "ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ" to "sARcASm" to "c,,ry ttypinng,".

- [WPM Meter](https://github.com/arxanas/plover_wpm_meter) - See the words per minute and strokes per word of your writing for the last 10 and 60 seconds.

### User Interface Replacements
