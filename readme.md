## Dictionaries

Dictionaries and python dictionaries to make the Plover experience better.

### Collections

- [Di's Steno Dictionaries](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries) - A wonderfully organized list of dictionaries from the maker of Typey Type with everything from removing misstrokes from Plover Theory, to advice on computer use, alternative locales, and programming.

## Plugins

### Commands

Plugins that control your system or Plover itself.

- [Dict Commands](https://github.com/KoiOates/plover_dict_commands) - Enable, disable, and reorder dictionaries with steno strokes.

### Dictionary Formats

Plugins that add new dictionary types.

- [Python Dictionary (.py)](https://pypi.org/project/plover-python-dictionary/) - Dictionaries that are small python scripts -- the possibilities are limitless! A few extremely useful Python dictionaries make this plugin a must-have.

### Text Macros

Plugins that affect text output and translation.

- [Fancy Text](https://github.com/psethwick/plover_fancytext) - Switch between typing in all sorts of exotic modes. It's essential if you want to keep up with the kids, supporting everything from "ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ" to "sARcASm" to "c,,ry ttypinng,".
- [Repeat last translation](https://github.com/nsmarkop/plover_last_translation) - Repeat the last translation (word, shortcut, emoji, etc.) with a single stroke.

### Tools

Widget-style plugins.

- [Spectra Lexer](https://github.com/fourshade/spectra_lexer) - A beautiful tool that explains why words are stroked the way that they are in your dictionary.
